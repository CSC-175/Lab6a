// Write a program that prompts the user to enter a multiple 
// digit positive integer then use a loop to iteratively construct 
// the value that is the reverse of that number, add the two numbers together, 
// and print the reverse value and sum to the screen. Note: Be sure that your 
// solution is not simply printing the digits of the number in reverse. 
// For example, if the number 462 was entered the your program will find 
// the reverse number is 264 and the sum of those two values is 1050.


// Place you solution code for the Find the Reverse of a Multi-digit program here
